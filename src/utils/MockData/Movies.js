      "December 30, 1941. In Vyazma ('Vyazemsky cauldron') there is a small group of Soviet soldiers, who are trying to reach their own comrades after having escaped a Nazi encirclement. In the movie they are suddenly caught in an unequal battle with a special unit of the Wehrmacht. None of these brave people was born a hero but they became heroes. And were helped in their battle by the Red Ghost. The myth of the red ghost of the movie is about a lone hero who picks off Nazi soldiers one by one. He seems to be able to vanish almost magically into the forests and even to come back from the dead.",

      "The bond between Nina and Wojtek seems less than an ideal partnership. Maybe that's because she's a brittle high school French teacher from an upper-middle-class intellectual family and he's a mechanic clearly out of his element in their elegant apartment. Airport security guard Magda is in a relationship with chic stewardess Ada, but she plays the field in the frequent times her lover is away. Then one day Nina absentmindedly backs into Magda's car, conveniently near Wojtek's shop. Attracted to Magda's natural beauty and palpable inner strength, Wojtek suggests to Nina that they seduce the young woman into being the surrogate they need to conceive the child that's meant to hold them together. But an unexpected love story develops slowly between two women which goes from being kept behind closed doors to public places. —Variety",

      "Born in British India, Gunga Din always wanted to join the British army like many of his fellow Indians, but Indians were not allowed to do so. So he starts observing the British and learns accordingly. He befriends Sgt. Archibald Cutter and warns him about a Thuggee uprising that may threaten their base. Sgt. Cutter and others are able to fend off the attack, but when Gunga gets information of a much larger rebel attack, Cutter accompanies him to the cult's temple embedded with gold statues of Hindu deities. Gunga finds out he is regarded as a traitor by his countrymen, and Cutter, as well as Sergeants MacChesney and Ballantine, is held captive by the Thuggees in a bid to force the British to leave India. —rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)",
